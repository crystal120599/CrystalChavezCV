        <h5><em>Introduction</em>, Oct. 14, 2020</h5>
        <p>Hello, I decided to add a blog to my page to record of what I have done
          so far in my journey to web development. Recently I finished the modules for
          HTML in the bootcamp I am doing in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy.</a>
          It's been fun doing the bootcamp so far and am for sure wanting to pursue a
          career in web development alongside my education in Computer Science. Tomorrow
          I have plans to start the next module in CSS and hope to style my website soon
          from my learning experience. My overall goal is to work for my favorite companies
          especially to become a web developer in eiher frontend, backend, or fullstack.</p>

        <h5>Oct. 15, 2020</h5>
        <p>It's been awhile from my last post, however during the past three days I am happy
          to say that I've learned more about CSS than before. I am in the process of learning fullstack
          web development in Udemy taught by Dr. Angela Yu and so far it's great. I've now
          got the basics of HTML and CSS down, before this I did had experience but never took
          it seriously til now. It amazes me what could be done when building a website, especially
          in CSS there are many ways to style through Inline, Internal, and External. Already I have built another
          website aside from this to display as a portfolio, as this website follows more with the course. Here's the link
          if you wish to check out my other page: <a href="https://crystal120599.github.io/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>. It's going
          to be fun after I practice for with HTML and CSS cause soon I will be going into Bootstrap 4.
